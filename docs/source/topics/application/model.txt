======================
Model Application
======================

The Basics
=========================

Lets assume we have a model called ``Project``, to setup a
:ref:`djpcms application <topics-applications-index>`
based on a database model, we create a class derived from
:class:`ModelApplication`::

	from djpcms.views import appsite
	
	class ProjectApplication(appsite.ModelApplication):
	    pass
    
A dynamic application is registered to the site by invoking::
	
	appsite.site.register('/project/', Project, ProjectApplication)
        

This application is pretty useless since it has no 
:class:`djpcms.views.appview.AppView` associated with it. Infact,
such application will throw an :class:`djpcms.core.exceptions.ApplicationUrlException`
because there are no views associated with it.
Here is an ``app`` which can be used for something meaningful::

	from djpcms.views import appsite, appview
	
	class ProjectApplication(appsite.ModelApplication):
	    search = appview.SearchView()
	    view   = appview.ViewView()
		
We can now search and view instances of ``Project``.
