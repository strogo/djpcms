Plugins
============================

Plugins are the design principle of ``djpcms``, without them there would be no
system, just a collection of python scripts!
Plugins are components that add capabilities to ``djpcms``
which, in turns, acts as a manager and placeholder for them.
Adding your own is extremely simple as well as moving them around
in a page.

Plugins are classes which derive from :class:`djpcms.plugins.DJPplugin`,
a straightforward python class. Plugins are not
database models, they simply describe how content is displayed
in a page and how users can interact with them. Thats it!

.. admonition:: How do we tell djpcms to include our plugins?

    Including plugins in your application is easy, simply add their dotted path to the :setting:`DJPCMS_PLUGINS` setting.

.. hint::

	Great no database required for plugins.
	
	How do we store them? :class:`djpcms.models.BlockContent`
	
	How do we add dynamic content? :class:`djpcms.views.appsite.ModelApplication`
